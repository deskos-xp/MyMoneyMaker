make a dynamic table mode that adjusts rows and columns base off of dict input

slight issue when changing tabs too quickly causes segfault, probably due to repeat requests, need to ensure that any requests being run while tab is changing is killed before starting a new one -- well i was definitely wrong, the segfault was caused by pyqtplot attempting to plot too many times before the request was finished


in both server and client do
	if uid == 0 use config in /opt/MyMoneyMaker
	else use config in $HOME/.cache/{server,client}_config.json 
luckily only server config needs to be worked on
